    <h1>Basic Tutor</h1>
    <p>
        Single tutor’s full attention throughout the lesson. Personalisaed lesson plans, explanations tailored to the individual child’s understanding (every child learns differently. E.g., visual or verbal learning. There are countless different learning approaches that every tutor is trained to spot which suits your child best, and execute lessons accordingly)

            source="Mrs Tan – Parent of Ethan, Primary 1"
            text="Ethan used to shy away from numbers, but within weeks he was asking to “play math” at home. The tutor’s warmth and games-based approach clicked in a way no other teacher managed."

            source="Madam Wong – Mother of Ryan, Primary 3"
            text="I’ve tried three tutors; none connected with Ryan until now. This teacher is friendly yet firm, and Ryan’s recent test jumped from 62 to 88. The change is remarkable."

            source="Mr Ng – Father of Zoe, Primary 4"
            text="Zoe used to freeze at word problems. The tutor broke them down into bite-size steps that made sense. Her latest result? 91/100. More important, she says math is “fun” again."

            source="Mrs Seah – Parent of Marcus, Primary 5"
            text="Marcus can be restless, but the tutor channels that energy into quick challenges and mini-rewards. His CA marks rose from a B to a strong A, and his teachers at school noticed the difference."

            source="Mr Ariff – Father of Aaliyah, Primary 6 (PSLE)"
            text="We were anxious about PSLE year. The tutor’s patient guidance and crystal-clear explanations helped Aaliyah leap from AL 5 to AL 2 in six months. We’re deeply grateful."

            source="Madam Koh – Mother of Gabriel, Secondary 1"
            text="Secondary math was a shock to Gabriel, yet this tutor bridged the gap smoothly. Friendly, relatable, and always ready with real-life examples. Grade climbed from 55 to 78."

            source="Mr Rahman – Father of Idris, Secondary 3"
            text="No tutor has motivated Idris like this one—weekly progress charts, personalised drills, and plenty of encouragement. His mid-year jumped nearly 20 points. Outstanding."
